# php_dom_parser
A DOM parser written in PHP capable of representing PHP and Ruby nodes

The reason behind re-inventing the wheel came from the necessity to convert a (huge) codebase of embeded PHP code whilst maintaining structure and PHP logic. I needed a DOM parser capable of working with PHP content nodes and offering facilities for search/replace at the DOM level.

(2017-10-07) Some improvements are still to be made... More to come.
